                Maidaan initiated ‘Property Ka Maidaan’ in April 2024, which
                organizes marketing, collaboration, and sales-oriented events
                across Pakistan and abroad. We envision showcasing various real
                estate projects during these events. Property Ka Maidaan
                symbolizes a one-stop destination. <b>#PropertyKaMaidaan</b>{" "}
                represents our aim to create a dynamic platform where the real
                estate industry can thrive through marketing, collaboration, and
                sales-oriented events. Property Ka Maidaan embodies our vision
                of bringing together stakeholders, showcasing projects, and
                fostering opportunities for growth and success within the real
                estate sector. Under this initiative, we have organized
                successful events in Lahore, Jhelum, Mirpur, and other cities,
                providing people with opportunities to invest not only in the
                local market but also in Dubai by showcasing Dubai investment
                opportunities. Our recent event, "Property Ka Maidaan," held in
                Doha, Qatar, marks our full entry into the international
                property market.
